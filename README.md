# 2023-Toyota-Gas-Mileage-Exploration
CNN writes in August 2023 that “U.S. gas prices climb to the highest level in nearly 10 months.”
While the news is informative I did not need to read the article to see the cause of that headline. I feel it every time I’m at the gas pump refueling my early 2000s car. And any American will tell you the same, “Gas is not gassing like it used to!”
As a result, I have decided to do a data exploration in order to find the most gas-efficient car within my favorite car brand, Toyota. By the end of this analysis, I will visually show what’s the best Toyota car to get based on car type and mileage.
Not only will my pockets be protected at the pump, but also the environment with fewer emissions and less reliance on natural gas.
